# java-graph-implementation

This reposiroty contains an implementation of an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix to store connections.

The connections are stored in a 2D integer array. Node objects hold a single string as data and are stored in a separate nodes array. 

A String-integer hashmap stores the relationship between a string and the index of the Node object that holds the value.
